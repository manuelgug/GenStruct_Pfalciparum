# Objective 3: Describe genetic structure of P. falciparum population in Mozambique in 2021 and 2022 and investigate the origin of parasites with variants of concern

### INDEX

# a) Determine genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in Mozambique
# • Intra-host diversity
#   ◦ Calculate MOI overall and means per province and region for each year (Naïve and eMOI, which incorporates intra-host relatedness between clones)
#   ◦ Calculate % of polyclonal infections per province and region for each year
#   ◦ Fixation index Fws??
# • Population genetic diversity: 
#   ◦ Calculate He per locus per province and region
#   ◦ Correlates with transmission intensity?
# Refs: Brokhattingen et al, preprint; Fola et al, Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01461-4 ; Kattenberg et al https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00960-22 

# b) Determine population structure and connectivity between parasite populations in Mozambique
# • PCA to determine population structure
# • Genetic differentiation (Fst) between provinces and regions
# • Proportion of related pairwise infections using IBD between provinces and regions
# Refs: Arnau; Brokhattingen et al, preprint; Fola et al, Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01461-4; Kattenberg et al https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00960-22; Gerlovina et al, Genetics 2022

# c) Determine clonal emergence vs spread from other regions for parasites carrying VOC (dhps581 and dhps436)
# • Map parasites with VOC on PCA (color)
# • Determine pairwise IBD between samples with variants of concern and wildtype parasites from the same or different areas. 
# Refs: daSilva et al, https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-04997-7; Fola et al, Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01461-4

# d) Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test will be used for the comparison of the distribution between populations, with Dunn’s test and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing in pairwise comparisons.

unique(db$run_id) #runs that I'll

# gonna need nida, year, region, province, run_id (ok)
# gonna need run_id of all samples (i can complete the ones that doesn't have it by grepping, np)
# which NIDA is the correct one? (according to a grep, it's NIDA2)
# MOI, calculate all together or per run? (ask simone/nanna!)
# entire runs or only samples in the DB?
# i don't have IMP_NEXTSEQ02_300522...
# no SMC2_run3?

# 2.- genomic data from all runs (allele data, resmarkers, haplos?)
